Daizu CMS  is an experimental content management system. It is an
attempt to build a solid base on which a more general CMS can eventually
be built. As such, it doesn't yet provide a simple user interface, but
it does solve some basic problems to do with tracking changes to
content.

There is documentation on the Daizu CMS website:
