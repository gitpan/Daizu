A short paragraph.

A long paragraph: Given an XHTML document (as an
L<XML::LibXML::Document> object), find all the attributes in the markup
which are relative URLs and turn them into absolute URLs relative to
C<$base_url>. This can be used to prepare content from an article to be
published in a different place with a different URL, such as in an RSS
feed or on an index page, while ensuring that any links or embedded
files continue to work.

Bullet list containing block markup:

 * Here is a nested list:

    * This indented list item contains quite a lot of text, broken up
      into two paragraphs. The second paragraph is just some prose from
      the Daizu API documentation.

      Return a string version of the DateTime object, formatted as a
      W3CDTF date and time. If $datetime is just a string, it is
      automatically validated and parsed by validate_date() first. If
      the value is invalid or undefined, then undef is returned.

   Another paragraph after the nested list.

Special chars should be preserved: ‘single quotes’ “double quotes”

    text inside blockquote element

    A long paragraph inside a blockquote: Most access to Daizu
    functionality requires a Daizu object. It provides a database handle
    for access to the 'live' content data, and a L<SVN::Ra> object for
    access to the Subversion repository.

        nested blockquote

A pre element containing some code, syntax highlighted (but the extra
span elements can be safely ignored when converting to text):

    sub add_html_dom_filter
    {
        my ($self, $object, $method) = @_;
        push @{$self->{html_dom_filters}}, [ $object => $method ];
    }
