=head1 NAME

Daizu::Revision - functions for loading revisions from Subversion

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These functions are used to load metadata about revisions (and the file
path changes made in them) from the Subversion into the PostgreSQL database.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

The following functions are available for export from this module.
None of them are exported by default.

=over

=item load_revision($cms, $desired_revnum)

Load information about new revisions, up to C<$desired_revnum>.
It starts from the revision after the last one which was loaded, and
is idempotent (so if you try to load the same revision twice there will
be no change).

If C<$desired_revnum> is not defined, loads up to the most recent revision
in the repository.

This can also be called as a method on a L<Daizu> object.

=item known_branches($db)

Return a reference to a hash of known branches.  The keys are the paths,
and the values are the ID numbers found in the C<branch> table.

Dies if it can't find a branch with the path C<trunk>, because that indicates
a broken database.

    croak "there is no branch called 'trunk' in the database"

    return \%branch;
}

=item branch_and_path($branches, $path)

Return a list of two values, the ID number and path of the branch
which a file at C<$path> would be in, whether or not it actually exists.
The path should be relative to the root of the repository, for example
C<trunk/foo.html>.  It doesn't mater whether C<$path> starts with a forward
slash.

Returns nothing if the path is not in any branch, in which case Daizu CMS
will simply ignore it.

    return ($branch_id, $path);
}

=item file_guid($db, $branch_id, $path, $revnum)

Returns a reference to a hash of information about the GUID for the file
in branch C<$branch_id> at C<$path> in revision C<$revnum>, or C<undef>
if there is/was no such file.

The hash will contain the following keys:

=over

=item id

GUID ID.

=item is_dir

True iff the associated file is a directory.

=item uri

The GUID URI (usually starting with C<tag:>).  This will be the custom
GUID URI if overridden by a C<daizu:guid> property.

=item custom_uri

True if a C<daizu:guid> property has overridden the automatically
generated GUID URI.

=item first_revnum

The number of the first revision in which C<$path> was used for this
file in this branch.

=item last_revnum

The number of the last revision in which C<$path> was used for this
file in this branch, or C<undef> if it is still being used in the most
recently loaded revision.
